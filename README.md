The proposed project aims to create a sophisticated Voice-Controlled Robot with
Computer Vision and Robotic Arm, using the latest technologies in voice recognition,
computer vision, and robotics. It uses computer vision to detect an object, ultrasonic
sensor to find the distance and robotic arm to pick up that object. The main goal is to
build a versatile and user-friendly robot that can understand spoken commands through
speech to text conversion, move around independently using computer vision, and
perform complex tasks accurately using its robotic arm. This combination of smart
features aims to provide a smooth and flexible robot that can be used in different areas
based on user requirements.
